# "Supervised Machine Learning with scikit-learn in Python"

## Description:

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing a hands-on example of supervised machine learning in Python using scikit-learn. In this repository, you'll find a Python script (ml_supervised_example.py) that walks through a basic ML workflow, covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Features:

### Data Loading and Exploration:

Learn how to load and explore datasets using Pandas.
Gain insights into the structure and characteristics of the data.

### Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing data and outliers.
Encode categorical variables for model compatibility.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### Model Training:

Utilize scikit-learn to train a supervised ML model.
Understand the basics of model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

### Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
Visualize key evaluation results.

### Prediction:

Apply the trained model to make predictions on new data.

### Requirements:

Python 3.x
scikit-learn library (pip install scikit-learn)
Pandas library (pip install pandas)

## Usage:

### Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-supervised-example.git

### Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Explore the script:

python ml_supervised_example.py

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this script as a starting point for your own supervised ML projects. If you find it helpful, don't forget to ⭐️ the repository!
